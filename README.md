# CarShareHub
<p>This application is a carpooling mobile application. Car Share Hub is name of this mobile application. Our main target is 
decreasing the fuel crisis. We think that carpooling method is helpful to save fuel and another solution for the current 
economic crisis in our country. Passengers can share the cost of the fuel and save money and it costs less than taking a 
taxi or use own vehicle. Vehicle owner can earn some money from his empty seats of his vehicle. Another advantage of 
that carpooling system helps to reduce traffic and save time of wasting the traffic. It helps to reduce air pollution is another
benefit of this system.
In this system we provide an interface for passengers and vehicle drivers to find each other for share a ride. Vehicle driver 
can enter the route and destination to the application. Then passengers can search their destination and route and they 
can request the ride and contact the vehicle driver. After the contact the vehicle driver, they can confirm the ride. System 
can auto generate the available seats and it shows the vehicle owner and passengers. System provide service for each 
other to see their profile and report or rating their profile. Each customer can daily update their route and destination and 
find a person to share a ride. System provides another service of notification system and every request notify to the 
customer.
We think that this application helps to current fuel crisis and easy method for their transportation. It helps to save their 
money and earn some money for one ride.
